    As of December 16, 2019, the original API rate limit (40 requests every 10 seconds) has been disabled. 
    For any questions, please visit our [API support forum](https://www.themoviedb.org/talk/category/5047958519c29526b50017d6).

Although the legacy rate limits have been disabled, we still enforce upper limits to prevent excessive bulk scraping. 
The current rate limit is 50 requests per second. 
You may receive a `429` status code if you exceed or misuse the API.

<Warning>
 This limit is subject to change at any time. Please use the service responsibly.
