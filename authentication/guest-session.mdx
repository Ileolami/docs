Guest sessions are a second type of user authentication. They have limited permissions as they can only rate a movie, TV show and TV episode. 
Creating a guest session is as simple as calling the new [guest session](https://ileolami.mintlify.app/api-reference/authentication/create-guest-session) method.

Just like a fully authorized user session, guest sessions should be kept private as they tie a session within your application to a single token.
