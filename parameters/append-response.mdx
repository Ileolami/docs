`append_to_response` is an easy and efficient way to append extra requests to any top level namespace. 
The movie, TV show, TV season, TV episode and person detail methods all support this query parameter. 
This makes it possible to make sub requests within the same namespace in a single HTTP request. 
Each request will get appended to the response as a new JSON object.

Here's a quick example,
let's assume you want the details and the videos for a movie. 
Usually you would think you have to issue two requests:
```shell Examples
curl --request GET \
     --url 'https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/11' \
     --header 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}'

curl --request GET \
     --url 'https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/11/videos' \
     --header 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}'
```
But with `append_to_response` you can issue a single request:
```shell Example
curl --request GET \
     --url 'https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/11?append_to_response=videos' \
     --header 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}'
```
Even more powerful, you can issue multiple requests, just comma separate the values:
```shell Example
curl --request GET \
     --url 'https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/11?append_to_response=videos,images' \
     --header 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}'
```
<Info>
Each method will still accept the query parameters supported by that specific request. This is especially important for images, as the language parameter will filter them. In such cases, the `include_image_language` parameter can be helpful, as explained on the [image language](/parameters/image_languages) page.
